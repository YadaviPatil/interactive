    What really stood out to me in this reading was the duality of technology. There seemed to be a back and forth about what the digital world can and can’t be which was interesting to hear about. Is the computer the work or the tool, do you work “within” the digital or “on” the digital. The comparison of working “within” as non-modern and working “on” as modern put it into perspective how the digital can mimic ideas and concepts that we are extremely familiar with.
    In the article “Jodi’s Infrastructure,” Alexander R Galloway states, “But the web is infinitely big. Like a fractal with its endless regress of complexity, a new web page can always be inserted between two existing ones, creating an infinitely large system.” This idea of the digital world being infinity big and can have elements added to it whenever mimics the art world in a way. Art can be created whenever by whoever and will live in the world, both the digital and art world and infinity big and as time progresses so do both these worlds. The comparison of the digital world and how it relates to art was interesting, but these lines are getting blurred now that digital art can be used as a medium for art.
