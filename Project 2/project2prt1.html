   <p>This chapter is really interesting because Lorde is talking about where she gets her determination and strength from. She uses her mother as a metaphor for resilience and power, a type of power that can not be described in any other way. Lorde dissects our understanding of power by using her mother as an example of how she is trying to define power. I love this chapter because she asks herself a lot of questions and try to answer them by sharing something about her mother. The whole chapter is very poetic, Lordeâ€™s writing is great because she is unraveling things about the character in a way that feels like we are watching her grow up. There are certain lines in the chapter that really stick out to me, I also think the questions she asks within the writing also stick out.

  -Have the whole text and then have the questions be clickable links that lead to another page?
  -Have the lines that stick out to me be a different typeface or weight?
  -use images maybe?
  -highlight questions, links to another page where people can put their own response
