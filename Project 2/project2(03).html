<p id="text1">I have often wondered why the farthest out positions always feel so right to me; Why extremes, although difficult and sometimes painful to maintain, are always more comfortable than one plan Running straight down a line in the unruffled middle. 

What I really understand is a particular kind of determination. it is stubborn, it is painful, it is infuriating, but it often works.

My mother was a very powerful woman. this was so in a time when the word-combination of woman and powerful was almost unexpressable in the white American common tongue, except or unless it was accompanied by some aberrant explaining adjective like blind or hunchback or crazy or Black. Therefore when I was growing up powerful woman equaled something else quite different from ordinary woman, from simply “woman” it certainly did not, on the other hand, equal “man”. </p>

<p id="text">As a child I always knew my mother was different from the other women I knew, black or white. I used to think it was because she was my mother.</p>

 <p id="text">I was never quite sure there were other west Indian women around, a lot in our neighborhood and church. There were also other black women as light as she, particularly among the low island women Redbone they were called. Different how? I never knew. But that is why to this day I believe that there have always been black dykes around– in the sense of powerful and women-oriented women– who Would rather have died then use that name for themselves. And that includes my mommma. </p>

<p id="text"> I've always thought that I learned some early ways I treated women from my father. But he certainly responded to my mother in a very different fashion. They shared decissions and the making of all policy, both in their business and in the family. Whenever anything had to be decided about any one of the three of us children, even about new coats, they would go into the bedroom and out their heads together for a little while, Buzz buzz would come through the closed door, sometimes in english, sometimes in patois, that Grenadian poly-language which was their lingua franca. Then the two of them would emerge and announce whatever decision had been arrived upon. </p>
